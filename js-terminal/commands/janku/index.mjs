"Granddaughter, Granddaughter, this is Uncle five reporting in.
We found the outpost on Gorham Colony, no resistance. The people made a dash
for their storm cellar the minute they realized we'd spotted them.
Only one functional ship. The job is done, no problems- one less set of
navigation data for those bastards to get their hands on. See you at the
rendezvous. Uncle Five out."
