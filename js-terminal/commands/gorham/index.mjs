`KOI-2650.01
Gorham Colony is an arid Earth-like planet orbiting a red giant that gives
a pale rusty-orange tinge to everything. Equatorial Daily temperatures only reach 10°C,
and not quite freezing at night. It has a long diurnal cycle of 36 hours, with little axial tilt
so both day and night are equal length.
